<h2>Version 4.1.4.5</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Disable PCars pit window messages by default (can be re-enabled with the enable_pcars_pit_window_messages setting) - this only works correctly in offline races</li>
	<li>Revised some of the PCars session-end logic to reduce the likelihood of the app detecting a session restart when one hasn't actually taken place. This should also prevent the app from removing cached laptime data (which results in inaccurate 'best lap' messages)</li>
