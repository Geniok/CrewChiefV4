Update the increment Assembly Information Assembly Version in CrewChiefV4 -> project -> properties (4.x.y.0) - this is needed for the autoupdater to work

Go to General Information in Organize Your Setup

Update the Product Version to match the Assembly Version
CAREFULLY change Product Code in Organize Setup -> General Info -> product code, generate a new GUID (on right of UI). DO NOT CHANGE THE UPGRADE CODE GUID

Ensure the build type is 'SingleImage' (white box in top tool bar), then clean / build to create a .msi with all the goodies packaged into it.


Update the contents of auto_update_data.xml - the title and version elements, and if necessary the sound pack version stuff
Update the change_log_for_auto_updated.txt

Push the newly built /.../SingleImage/DiskImages/DISK1/CrewChiefV4.msi and the 2 text files up to DropBox, overwriting the existing ones (and therefore keeping the same URLs)
